<hr>

### A simple Python module that when used asks you to input some text that you need to _ENCRYPT_ and a _key_ that is used to encrypt the text with the unique combination of the given _key_ and the text this is to be _encrypted_. Only the person who knows the _key_ can crack the encoded text! Without that _key_, even I(_the developer of this program_) cannot **crack the** _encrypted text_!
